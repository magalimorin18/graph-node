# Getting Started

To understand what is The Graph and how we can use it to extract information of ERC725 account, read the `Investigation.md` file in the `docs` folder.

## Installation

```
yarn install
```

## Run a graph node locally

```
docker-compose up
```

This will start IPFS, Postgres and Graph Node in Docker and create persistent
data directories for IPFS and Postgres in `./data/ipfs` and `./data/postgres`. You
can access these via:

- Graph Node:
  - GraphiQL: `http://localhost:8000/`
  - HTTP: `http://localhost:8000/subgraphs/name/<subgraph-name>`
  - WebSockets: `ws://localhost:8001/subgraphs/name/<subgraph-name>`
  - Admin: `http://localhost:8020/`
- IPFS:
  - `127.0.0.1:5001` or `/ip4/127.0.0.1/tcp/5001`
- Postgres:
  - `postgresql://graph-node:let-me-in@localhost:5432/graph-node`

The logs will show the current block head. You can compare it with whatâ€™s in the block explorer.
The subgraph is running locally and is connected to the correct blockchain.

## Deploy a subgraph to the running Graph Node

This command will generate a folder `generated` which files are used in `src/mapping.ts`.

```javascript
yarn codegen
```

```
yarn create-local
```

```
yarn deploy-local
```

Note : `yarn deploy-local` command might ask you to run the following command.

```
graph create --node http://127.0.0.1:8020 example
```

### Understand the purpose of each file

File `subgraph.yaml` (the subgraph manifest) specifies information on the Smart Contract we are indexing, the events that are emitted by the smart contract and the network we are connecting to.
In our case, we are indexing the smart contract :

    - event: DataChanged(indexed bytes32,bytes)
          handler: handleUpdatedUP

File `schema.graphql` specifies the entities we store in the subgraph.

File `mapping.ts` specifies the functions to run when a specific event is emitted. The functions store the pieces of information we want in the database of the graph.

### Example

1. An event `DataChanged` is emitted by the smart contract `0x41D0ADD4e04fd73598244cab0090E7D8042597f9`.

2. The function `handleUpdatedUP` is triggered.
   The parameters is the `dataKey` of LSP3Profile data and the dataValue. dataValue could be use to decode the data but we are using erc725js library instead.
   `fetchData` function withdraws the UP data from ipfs.
   The function checkes if data with the id `dataKey` already exists. If no, it creates a new entity Data with a dataKey id. If yes, it updates its values.
   Finally, the function saves the entity.

## Improvement

- Add the profileImage in the Data entity (file `schema.graphql`).

## Connect to pgadmin to visualise data

- Create a new server on pgadmin
- Connect to the database

```
POSTGRES_USER: graph-node
POSTGRES_PASSWORD: let-me-in
POSTGRES_DB: graph-node
PGDATA: "/data/postgres"
```

## Blocker

(26.10.2022)

1. The Graph is not supporting external libraries like web3 or erc725js yet.
   In mapping.ts we use the libraries to extract teh information on ERC725 account. Without these libraries we can t decode the event sent by the smart contract.
   ![importlibraries](docs/pictures/importlibraries.png)

2) A subgraph is listening to the event emitted by a smart contract. In our case, it would mean we would have one subgraph for each universal profile.

## Helpers

- Issue with connecting the subgraph to the graph node : display the logs of the container

```
docker logs --follow CONTAINER
```

- Issue with building the subgraph when running `yarn create-local`: build step by step the mapping.ts file to understand at which line the issue is.

```
yarn build
```
